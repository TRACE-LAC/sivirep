Current version of *sivirep* provides functions for data wrangling and automated reports based on linelist data from [SIVIGILA](https://www.ins.gov.co/Direcciones/Vigilancia/Paginas/SIVIGILA.aspx), which is the official epidemiological surveillance system for Colombia, South America.

## Motivation

Latin America has progressed in the quality of epidemiological notification and surveillance systems. Particularly, Colombia has improved over the years the quality and openness of its official epidemiological surveillance system, [SIVIGILA](https://www.ins.gov.co/Direcciones/Vigilancia/Paginas/SIVIGILA.aspx). This system is regulated by Colombia's National Institute of Health and operated by thousands of health workers at local secretaries of health, hospitals, and local notification units. 

However, some challenges remain particularly at local levels in terms of timeliness and quality of epidemiological analytics and epidemiological reports. These tasks may involve a great deal of manual labor reinforced by limitations in training for data analytics, time,  technology and quality of internet access in some locations. 

`sivirep` is aimed at providing a set of customisable functions for: 

1) downloading, pre-processing and preparing SIVIGILA data for further analytics 
2) producing customisable epidemiological automated reports 
3) getting feedback on the surveillance system to the source provider 

## Potential users

- Public health professionals and field epidemiologist users of SIVIGILA source at local levels
- Epidemiology and public health students
- National and international researchers and data analysts

## Installation

You can install the development version of `sivirep` from GitHub with:

```{r}
# install.packages("remotes")
# remotes::install_github("epiverse-trace/sivirep")   
library(sivirep)
```

## Quick start

```{r}
list_of_diseases <- list_available_diseases_years()
knitr::kable(list_of_diseases)
```

## Future versions

Future versions of `sivirep` may include

- Interaction with other data sources in Colombia
- Other epidemiological surveillance systems in Latin America

## Get Started

### For automated reporting

After installation and importation of the library you can start using `sivirep`:

```{r}
library(sivirep)
```

Check the list of diseases available to make a report with `sivirep` in: 

```{r results = 'hide'}
list_available_diseases_years()
```

Currently, `sivirep` provides a report template `Reporte Básico {sivirep}`, which contains six sections and receive two input parameters: disease (the disease name) and year in order to download the data from SIVIGILA source. 

The template can be used by following the following steps:

1. In RStudio click *'File/New File/R'* Markdown:

<img src="../man/figures/file_rmarkdown.png" align="right" width="550px" style="margin-left: 2.8em;     margin-top: 0.8em; margin-bottom: 0.8em; float: none;"/>

2. Select the left panel option: *'From Template'*, then select the template report called `Reporte Básico {sivirep}`, indicate the name you want for the report (i.e. MyReport_Laura), the location to store it and press *'Ok'*.

<img src="../man/figures/reporte_basico.png" align="right" width="550px" style="margin-left: 2.8em;     margin-top: 0.8em; margin-bottom: 0.8em; float: none;" />

3. Then, you can select the disease (the disease name) and the year of the report. This action will download the data wanted and also will provide the template in R Markdown .Rmd file. For this, it is important to find Knit button, display the options and select *'Knit with parameters'*.

<img src="../man/figures/button_knit.png" align="right" width="550px" style="margin-left: 2.8em;     margin-top: 0.8em; margin-bottom: 0.8em; float: none;"/>

4. Wait a few seconds while the report is rendered in a PDF file. 

5. You can add, edit, delete and customise sections of the report in the R Markdown file generated earlier.

<img src="../man/figures/editable_rmarkdown.png" align="right" width="550px" style="margin-left: 2.8em;  margin-top: 0.8em; margin-bottom: 0.8em; float: none;"/>

For more details on generic Rmarkdown templates and reports please see [rmarkdown templates](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/rmarkdown_templates.html).

## For customisable analytics or reports

This section provides a basic set of instructions for using `sivirep` 0.0.1 if:
- You have already produced an .Rmd file and you want to edit a report 
- You want to perform customised analytics without an .Rmd file

### 1. Importing sivigila data

The SIVIGILA source provides the historical linelist data up to the latest closed epidemiological year. The closing of an epidemiological year usually occurs in April next year (i.e. if you’re using `sivirep` in march 2023, you may be able to access the historical data up to December 2021) for most diseases with a few exceptions.  

Please check the available diseases and years, using: 

```{r results = 'hide'}
list_of_diseases <- list_available_diseases_years()
```

Once you have decided the disease and year you want, `import_linelist_disease_year` is the function that allows importation of data from sivigila service using a parameterised format based on disease and year. 

```{r}
disease_data <-  import_linelist_disease_year(year = 2020, 
                                              disease_name = "dengue")
```

### 2. Cleansing sivigila data

SIVILA data is a highly trusted official source of information with ISO certification of data quality. Nevertheless, sometimes there are some potential outliers in the data that may need some additional cleansing. 

`sivirep` provides a wrapper generic function called `cleansing_sivigila_data` for identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and discrepancies in the datasets to improve their quality and accuracy. This process can include removing duplicates, correcting typographical errors, imputing missing values, and validating data, among other tasks, such as removing improbable dates, cleaning geolocation codes, and standardising column names and age categories. 

```{r}
clean_disease_data <- cleansing_sivigila_data(disease_data, year = 2020)
```

The cleansing functions inside `cleansing_sivigila_data` have been gathered and built based on the experience from field epidemiologists. These may include internal functions such as:
`clean_labels`: function that cleans and standardises the column names of SIVIGILA linelist data based on SIVIGILA data dictionary.

- `clean_disease_ages`: function that cleans ages of SIVIGILA linelist data 
- `format_dates_values`: function that gives a specific format to a date
- `clean_disease_dates`: function that cleans dates from the disease data
- `clean_depto_codes`: function that cleans the  geographical department codes of the disease data

The user may want to use these functions individually or simply use the generic wrapper cleansing function `cleansing_sivigila_data`

### 3. Temporal distribution of cases

In `sivirep` the temporal distribution of cases is defined by the variables symptom onset date and notification date, for each of these variables there are specialised functions to group the data and generate the plots. 

#### 3.1. Group the data by onset symptoms at the desired temporal scale

To generate the distribution of cases by symptom onset date it is necessary to group the data by these variables. `sivirep` provides a function that allows this grouping called `group_onset_symptoms`, in which you can specify the time unit to group these dates, the allowed values for this parameter are: day and month. 

```{r}
cases_onset_symptoms_by_day <- group_onset_symptoms(clean_disease_data, type = "day") 
cases_onset_symptoms_by_month <- group_onset_symptoms(clean_disease_data, type = "month") 
```

<div>
    <img src="../man/figures/tip.svg" align="right" width="60" style="margin-right: 2.8em; margin-bottom: 0.8em;"/>
    <p>Tip 2 - Get the first n months with most cases</p>
    <p>When building a report section or analysing this data it can be useful to get the months with the most cases, in sivirep you can use the function get_months_most_cases to get this information.</p>
</div>

The graph that allows to visualise this distribution must be generated with the function `plot_onset_symptoms`. Please notice that even if you have grouped the data by day you may prefer to plot it by month, as in:

```{r fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
plot_onset_symptoms(data_grouped = cases_onset_symptoms_by_day,
                    break_tick_date = "months")
```

#### 3.2. Group the data by notification date at the desired temporal scale

The process to generate the distribution of cases by notification date consist in group the disease data by this variables, you can use the following function of `sivirep` to do this:

```{r}
cases_notification_date_by_day <- group_notification_date(clean_disease_data, 
                                                    type = "day") 
cases_notification_date_by_month <- group_notification_date(clean_disease_data, 
                                                      type = "month") 
```

The graph that allows to visualise this distribution must be generated with the function `plot_notification_date`. Please notice that even if you have grouped the data by day you may prefer to plot it by month, as in:

```{r fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
plot_notification_date(data_grouped = cases_notification_date_by_day,
                       break_tick_date = "months")
```


### 4. Age and sex

### 4.1. Sex variable

When analysing or reporting disease data, it is often necessary to determine the distribution of cases by gender or sex. However, the SIVIGILA source only records sex. 

`sivirep` provides a function that aggregates and computes percentages by sex automatically after the cleansing process.

```{r}
cases_sex <- group_sex(disease_data = clean_disease_data, 
                       percentage = TRUE)
```

Also, `sivirep` has a `plot_sex` function:

```{r fig.height = 3, fig.width = 7}
plot_sex(data_grouped = cases_sex)
```

The distribution of cases by sex and epidemiological week can be using the `group_sex_epiweek` function provided by `sivirep`

```{r}
cases_sex_epiweek <- group_sex_epiweek(disease_data = clean_disease_data)
```

The corresponding visualisation function is `plot_sex_epiweek` that provides `sivirep`:

```{r fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
plot_sex_epiweek(data_grouped = cases_sex_epiweek)
```

### 4.2. Age variable

Age is an important variable to analyse, as it is a known risk factor for many diseases. Certain diseases and conditions tend to occur more frequently in specific age groups, and this distribution can help identify populations at higher risk and implement targeted prevention and control strategies. 

`sivirep` provides a function called `group_age`, which can group disease data by age groups. By default this function produces age ranges with intervals of 10 years. Also, users can customise a different age range.

```{r}
cases_age <- group_age(disease_data = clean_disease_data, age_interval = 10)
```

The corresponding plot function is `plot_age`

```{r fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
plot_age(data_grouped = cases_age)
```


### 4.3. Age and sex simultaneously

`sivirep` provides a function called `group_age_sex`, which can group disease data by age ranges and sex simultaneously and obtain their number of cases and percentages. Also, the age interval can be customised.

```{r}
cases_age_sex <- group_age_sex(disease_data = clean_disease_data, 
                               age_interval = 10)

```

The corresponding plotting function is `plot_age_sex`.

```{r fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
plot_age_sex(data_grouped = cases_age_sex)
```

### 5. Spatial distribution of cases

Obtaining the spatial distribution of cases is helpful to identify areas with a high concentration of cases, disease clusters and environmental or social risk factors. 

In Colombia, there 32 administrative geographic units (adm1) called departments. `sivirep` provides a function called `group_deptos` which allows obtaining a data.frame of grouped cases by department.

```{r}
spatial_dept_dist <- group_dept(disease_data = clean_disease_data)
```

Currently, with  the function called `plot_dept_map` the user can produce a static map of Colombia with the distribution of cases by departments.

```{r fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7}
plot_dept_map(data_grouped = spatial_dept_dist)
```
