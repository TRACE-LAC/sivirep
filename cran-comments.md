* This is a new release.

* sivirep currently has its documentation, function names, and website in Spanish, as user testing in various regions of Colombia, such as the Choc√≥ department, revealed that having these components in English posed a significant barrier. Many users in these areas are not proficient in English, which increases learning curves and limits the adoption of the tool. This package is expected to be used by Health Departments and Professionals throughout the country to facilitate the generation and access to epidemiological reports from SIVIGILA (National Public Health Surveillance System).
